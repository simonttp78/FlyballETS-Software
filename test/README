This directory consist python script and testcases for FlyballETS software
algorithm testing.

Pre-conditions:
- FlyballETS firmware need to be compiled in Simulated flag set to True
- accuracy of measurements need to be set to 3 digits
- script need to be lunched via terminal while being in test folder

Examples:
- run testcases 1, 3, 4 and 8 in normal mode (minimized prints to console):
python3 testETS.py 1,3,4,8

- run testcases 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 in debug mode (serial transmision printed to console)
python3 testETS.py 4-8 -d

- run all testcases from 'testcases' folder in normal mode (minimized prints to console):
python3 testETS.py -all

- run all testcases in loop for 1 hour in normal mode (minimized prints to console):
python3 testETS.py -stab

Testcases:
At the beginning of every testcase file there are "$innit" parameters (divided by ";") determining system setup for testcase.

If testcase requires you to send command while the test is running, in next line after "$innit" there should be
a line with "$commend" parameters where first parameter determines time in seconds after which the command is sent 
and second parameter being the command you want to send.  (eg. "$command;8.5;d2f;")

Results are stored in two forms in "results" folder consisting subfolders for each
script execution with timestamps in the name. There is one "!summary.txt" file
with overall results as well dedicated files with more details per each testcase.
